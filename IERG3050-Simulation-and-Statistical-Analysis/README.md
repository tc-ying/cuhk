# Capstone Project : Queueing of Café de Coral during weekday lunch hour

Fast food is about serving speed. In Café de Coral, we surveyed how long it takes for a new customer to arrive and to complete his / her order. Those times are supposed to have a pattern, i.e. probability distribution.

## Give me an arrival and service time pattern. How to serve fastest?

To improve speed, we held arrival and service time constant and tweak other parameters of the queueing system. Number of cashiers or food trays on the line could be optimized. Resources could move between [roasted meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siu_mei) and regular food lines, depending on whether it is lunch or tea time. We simulated different arrangements with [CSIM](http://csim.sourceforge.net/).
