## Emergent Behavior

[Game of Life](https://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1) plays on an infinite grid of cells. Each cell has 2 states — on / off. Rules about when to switch on and off govern each cell individually. Despite cells do not communicate with each other, group patterns [emerge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence).

## Universal Turing Machine

We exploit these patterns and emulate *0s* and *1s* and *logical AND / OR / NOT* on the grid. Physical computers are nothing more than these same logical bits and functions. This virtual computer constructed in *Game of Life* too must have eqaul computing power — i.e. [universal computing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).
