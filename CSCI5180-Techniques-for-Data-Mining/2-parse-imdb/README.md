## Preprocessing Script Instructions

 1. Run `imdb.sh` to get the search result pages with links to movie pages.
 2. Run `looppages.sh` to go through the search result pages for links to user review pages. Links are saved to `booyahlist.txt`. (The list is removed in the beginning of the script, so make backups!)
 3. Run `getreviews.sh` to construct the big-ass-file of movie reviews and ratings.
 4. Run `wordoccurences.sh` to count word occurences.
